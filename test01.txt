What is Git? Why is it used? Basic commands in Git?
Git is the most popular tool among all the DVCS tools.
Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple  people, it is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.

We can do the following tasks when working with GIT,Let us explore the commands related to each of these tasks.
•	Creating repository
•	Making changes
•	Parallel development
•	Syncing repositories.

Creating repository
We can create a repository using the command gitinit , for that we have to navigate the project folder and enter the above command to initiate a git repository for our project in local system,(NOTE:- Before doing so make sure we have installed the GIT in windows, Linux OS)
Cmd commands.
#Create a directory  (mkdir)                C:\Users\netzary>mkdir devops
#Create a file inside a directory (type nul >)               type nul > hello.txt   Note:-Don’t press enter after > here we have to specify the file name
From working directory Git directory
Gitinit
o/p Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/netzary/devops/.git/
Knowing the status of files in directory
Git status
 
Git add :-
Adding the file so that git can track the files
Commit
Once the files or changes have been staged, we are ready to commit them into our repository.we can commit the files using the command
git commit -m “Custom message”            
Making changes
The file will come as modified filename.txt when we type the git status, for saving the modified changes we have to commit the file again in Git.
Making available to world
For that we have to create a reposity in github and copy the https link and paste it in cmd.

git remote add origin “<URL to repository>”
